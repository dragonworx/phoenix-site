        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          At Phoenix Yoga, we believe in the transformative power of ancient yoga practices
          combined with modern understanding of body mechanics. Like the mythical phoenix
          rising from the ashes, we guide our students through a journey of renewal,
          self-discovery, and personal transformation.

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Our approach honors the traditional eight limbs of yoga while making the practice
          accessible and relevant to contemporary life. We create a sanctuary where ancient
          wisdom meets modern wellness.

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Phoenix Yoga was born from a vision to create more than just a yoga studio.
          Founded in 2018 by a group of dedicated practitioners, we set out to build a
          space that would serve as a beacon of light in our community.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          What started as a small studio with just three instructors has grown into a
          vibrant community of over 500 active members. Through the challenges of recent
          years, we&apos;ve adapted and evolved, offering both in-person and virtual classes
          to meet our students wherever they are on their journey.
